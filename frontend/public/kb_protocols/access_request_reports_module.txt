4. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
   ├─ Active Directory/LDAP Configuration:
   │  • Add user to appropriate security groups:

   │  • Tableau: Grant server access with financial data permissions
   │  • Custom Systems: Update user profile with new role assignments
   │  • Database: Grant SELECT permissions on cost-related tables
   │
   ├─ Multi-Factor Authentication:
   │  • Verify MFA is enabled for all financial data access
   │  • Test authentication with user before granting access
   │  • Document MFA method (app, SMS, hardware token)
   │
   └─ Access Testing:
      • Login as user to verify access works correctly
      • Test specific cost view functionality
      • Confirm appropriate data filtering by department/role
      • Verify no unauthorized data exposure

5. USER ONBOARDING & TRAINING
   ├─ Access Notification:
   │  • Send welcome email with access details
   │  • Include links to training materials and documentation
   │  • Provide contact information for support
   │  • Set expectations for responsible use
   │
   ├─ Mandatory Training Components:
   │  • Reports module navigation and basic functionality
   │  • Cost data interpretation and limitations
   │  • Data confidentiality and sharing policies

   │
   └─ Documentation Handover:
      • User guide for reports module
      • Cost view feature documentation
      • Data glossary and definitions
      • Emergency contact procedures

6. ACCESS MONITORING & COMPLIANCE
   ├─ Initial Monitoring (First 30 days):
   │  • Review user activity logs weekly
   │  • Monitor for unusual access patterns
   │  • Verify user follows data handling policies

TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:

Issue: "User can access reports but not see cost data"
Solution:
- Verify user is in correct security group for cost view
- Check database permissions on financial tables
- Test with a known working account to isolate issue
- Review application role assignments

Issue: "Access granted but reports show 'No Data Available'"
Solution:
- Confirm user's department assignment in HR system
- Verify data filtering rules are correctly applied
- Check if user needs additional permissions for specific cost centers
- Test with sample cost data to verify connectivity

Issue: "Manager approval delay holding up urgent access"
Solution:
- Escalate to department head for approval
- Document business urgency and impact
- Consider temporary read-only access pending full approval
- Set up automatic reminder for delayed approvals

Issue: "User sees unauthorized financial data"
Solution:
- Immediately suspend access and investigate
- Review security group memberships for over-permissioned roles
- Check data filtering configuration
- Document incident and report to security team

Issue: "Reports module slow or timing out for user"
Solution:
- Check user's network connectivity and browser
- Verify database query performance for large datasets
- Consider limiting initial data range for new users
- Review server resource utilization during peak times
