I hope this email finds you well. I understand you're having trouble with your emails not being delivered, and I'm here to help you resolve this.

Here are some simple steps we can try:

1. **Check if emails are being blocked**: Sometimes email systems can mistakenly block messages. I can help you verify if this is happening to your emails.

2. **Look for returned messages**: Check your inbox for any messages that came back saying the email couldn't be delivered. These will help us understand what's going wrong.

3. **Review recent email activity**: We can look at your recent email activity to see if there are any patterns or specific issues.

Don't worry - these email delivery problems are usually easy to fix once we identify the cause. I'll guide you through each step personally.

Please reply to this email if you'd like to start with these steps, or if you have any questions.

Best regards,
IT Support Team"""
